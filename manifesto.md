title: MathML Manifesto
---

Warning: this is a draft.

1) Mathematical Language

   The mathematical language is fundamental for educational and scientific
   communication and must be handled by internet tools with the same
   consideration as any other human language.

2) Open Standards

   In order to guarantee compatibility for data exchange, mathematical
   rendering and authoring tools must rely on open formats and more
   specifically on the MathML specification. When extension or improvements are
   necessary, they must be conducted in a public standardization process.

3) Availability

   MathML must be used on the internet to encode mathematical formulas. For
   static formulas, it must be provided in the source code of web pages or
   electronic mails in order to make it usable by the largest number of tools,
   including web crawlers and browsers without support for script language such
   as Javascript.

4) Web Engines

   Web engines providing visual rendering of documents with complex layout
   must also support native and fast display of MathML formulas, in a way
   compatible with the layout, styling or dynamic update that are available for
   other web content. Mathematical fonts must contain appropriate data to make
   possible for web engines to use them for a good mathematical rendering.

5) Accessibility

   Assistive technologies used to read or edit documents must be able to
   handle MathML in order to make mathematical formulas accessible to disabled
   persons.

6) Internationalization

   Mathematical tools must support the miscellaneous scripts and notations
   permitted by MathML and Unicode in order to take into account the cultural
   differences of mathematical writing. This includes supporting non-latin
   alphabets and bidirectional writing.

7) Security and Privacy

   Security and Privacy are important features for internet users. MathML must
   be implemented in web engines and assistive technologies without losing
   these features. Web services for mathematical content should also guarantee
   these features to their users.

8) Authoring

   Authoring tools must give individuals the opportunity to write and edit
   MathML formulas or to convert them from other mathematical representations.
