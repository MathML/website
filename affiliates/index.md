The MathML Association intends to gather all the individuals and organizations
willing to advance the mission of the [MathML manifesto](/legal-documents/manifesto.html). For that purpose, we have settled
a [status of affiliates](/legal-documents/affiliates.html) that enables each
one to contribute at the desired level:

- [Sponsors](sponsors.html) are companies or organizations recognizing the
  importance of MathML and willing to help MathML Association projects by
  making an annual contribution and possibly getting involved in the
  MathML Advisory Board.

- [Partners](partners.html) are companies or organizations with
  technical expertise in open source development of Web engines or related
  technologies (math fonts, accessibility tools etc). They are privileged
  interlocutors for technical discussions, collaborations and contracts on
  MathML Association projects.

- [Friends](friends.html) are individuals willing to support our mission and are
  free to contribute as they wish. For example, they can
  [make a donation](donate.html) to the MathML Association or do volunteer work
  on MathML Association projects. Prominent friends may be invited to become
  members of the MathML Advisory Board.

Please send an email to [{{site.email}}](mailto:{{site.email}}) if you are
interested in becoming an affiliate.
