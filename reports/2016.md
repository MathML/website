# Annual Activity Report 2016: MathML Association

The main activity of the Mondial Association for Tools Handling MathML, ltd (for short,
MathML Association) in 2016 has been starting outreach campaigns to make the Association
more known, liaising with other MathML-related organizations, and starting first technical
projects to enhance MathML support in browsers.

In general the work of the Association in 2016 it has been  hindered by
* constraints imposed by the incorporation as a New York organization
* moves between institutions by its directors
* insecurities about NY as a stable operational basis. 
In particular, as a cause of this, we have not resolved the matter of initiating financial
transactions for funding browser enhancements as planned. 

In the following we tabulate the activities chronologically
