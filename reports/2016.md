# Annual Activity Report 2016: MathML Association

The main activity of the Mondial Association for Tools Handling MathML, ltd (for short,
MathML Association) in 2016 has been starting outreach campaigns to make the Association
more known, liaising with other MathML-related organizations, and starting first technical
projects to enhance MathML support in browsers.

In general the work of the Association in 2016 has been hindered by
* constraints imposed by the incorporation as a New York organization
* moves between institutions by its directors
* insecurities about NY as a stable operational basis. 
In particular, as a cause of this, we have not resolved the matter of initiating financial
transactions for funding browser enhancements as planned. 

In the following we tabulate the activities chronologically

* "2016-01-21" Frédéric Wang announced he will join Igalia the 1st of March and thus will step down as a director since this could potentially cause conflict of interests when the board has to decide funding of MathML projects.
