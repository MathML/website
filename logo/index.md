title: MathML Association Logo

Introduction
------------

This page contains a list of logos for the MathML Association in
different formats and sizes. You can also download the SVG, PNG, EPS and
PDF logos in a single [ZIP archive](mathml-logos.zip).

The files listed in [manifest.txt](./manifest.txt)
constitute a "Work" that may be distributed and/or modified under
[LaTeX Project Public License](http://latex-project.org/lppl/)
either version 1.3c of this license or (at your option) any later version.
Here are some suggestions to easily use the logos in compliance with the
license:

- Directly use the "Work" distributed by the MathML Association (clause 1 of
  the license). For example, if you want to insert the image in your Web page,
  you can just use the URLs of the website of the MathML Association.
- Distribute an unmodified copy of the "Work" (clause 2 of the license).
  For example, extract the whole ZIP archive on your Web server to use
  the SVG or PNG logos in your Web pages.
- Distribute a "Derived Work" consisting of one or more unmodified image files
  together with a modified `manifest.txt` listing  only the files kept from the
  original "Work" (clause 5 of the license). Update `manifest.txt` to clearly
  state that the "Derived Work" is only a subset of the original "Work"
  (clause 6.a of the license) and to provide a link to the present web page
  (clause 6.d.2 of the license). For example, if you only wish to insert the EPS
  logos in your LaTeX documents, you could distribute them with the following
  `manifest.txt` file:

      %% manifest.txt

      % and bitmap formats in order to integrate them into the logo files. The

Rectangular Logo (Image + Trademark)
------------------------------------

<p>
This is a rectangular logo, divided into two parts. The left hand-side
contains an image of the mathematical formula
<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" alttext="the W-th root of open paren W raised to the power W close paren">
  <semantics>
    <mroot><msup><mi>w</mi><mi>w</mi></msup><mi>w</mi></mroot>
    <annotation encoding="TeX">\sqrt[w]{w^w}</annotation>
    <annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content">
      <apply>
        <root/>
        <degree><ci>ùë§</ci></degree>
        <apply>
          <power/>
          <ci>ùë§</ci>
          <ci>ùë§</ci>
        </apply>
      </apply>
    </annotation-xml>
  </semantics>
</math>
written in green on a black background that has the shape of a square with
rounded corner. This image suggests mathematics and the World Wide Web.
The right hand-side contains the left-aligned sans-serif text "MathML
Association" with "MathML" written in black on the first line and
"Association" written in green on the second line.
