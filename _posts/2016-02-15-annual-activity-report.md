We recently celebrated the first year of existence of the MathML Association!
In 2015, we set up the organization structure, started
outreach campaigns, liaised with other MathML-related organizations, and
launched first technical projects to enhance
MathML support in browsers. We just published our
[annual activity report](/reports/2015.html) where you can find
further details.
