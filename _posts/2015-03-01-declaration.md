On February 24, we submitted our application as a charitable organization under
the Not-for-Profit Corporation Law of the State of New York and we are pleased
to announce that the Mondial Association for Tools Handling MathML, ltd
(for short, MathML Association) is now [officially registered](http://appext20.dos.ny.gov/corp_public/CORPSEARCH.ENTITY_INFORMATION?p_nameid=4765945&p_corpid=4714991&p_entity_name=Mondial&p_name_type=A&p_search_type=BEGINS&p_srch_results_page=0)! This is the first step towards a legal structure to promote MathML and fund MathML developments... Stay tuned for further progress!
